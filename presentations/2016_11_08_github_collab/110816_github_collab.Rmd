## Where do I begin?

For a basic review of Git (the version control system) and Github (the code-hosting platform), take a look at Brian Stock's notes from last week ("2016_11_01_github_intro").

## Basic Github Collaboration (shared repository model)

1. You want to start with an up-to-date local copy of the shared repository. If you don't currently have a local copy, you can create one using the "git clone" command. Otherwise, just pull the most recent changes.

2. Make a new branch for your changes. This allows you to make changes and commit them without worrying that you'll be causing a conflict with someone else's commits. Please choose a descriptive name for the new branch (maybe even including your username). 

[Note that we are running these commands in the shell.]

    $ git checkout -b hye_github_collab

3. This should create the new branch and set our local Git repo to point to that branch. We can now make changes, and commit them to this new branch.
